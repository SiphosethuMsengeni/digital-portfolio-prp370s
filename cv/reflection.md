# CV Reflection 

**Situation**: As part of the PRP370S portfolio and my career development, I was required to create a professional CV to present my skills, education, and experience.  

**Task**: My task was to build a well-structured CV using Markdown that could be included in my digital GitHub portfolio and also used in real job applications.  

**Action**: I gathered all my academic records, work experience, and personal details, then formatted them in a clear and organized Markdown file. I ensured that all information was accurate and relevant, and highlighted key strengths such as programming, customer service, and teamwork.  

**Result**: I produced a professional CV that not only fits the PRP370S requirements but also reflects my skills and readiness for internships and full-time ICT roles. I now feel more confident applying for opportunities in the tech industry.
