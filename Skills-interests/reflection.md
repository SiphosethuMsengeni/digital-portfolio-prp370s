# Skills and Interests Reflection (STAR)

**Situation**: I completed the Skills and Interests module on Blackboard as part of the Work Readiness Programme at CPUT.  
**Task**: My goal was to identify and reflect on my personal values, skills, and interests and understand how they influence career decisions.  
**Action**: I completed a self-assessment activity and quiz that covered values, skills (including transferable ones), and interest types. I scored 100% in the quiz.  
**Result**: I realized that I am most interested in creative and technical tasks. I value teamwork, problem-solving, and continuous learning. This aligns well with careers in web development, UI/UX design, or IT support.
